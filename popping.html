    <h2>Popping</h2>
    <p>Popping is a street dance adapted out of the earlier <b>Boogaloo (funk dance) cultural movement</b> in Oakland, 
        California. As Boogaloo spread, it would be referred to as Robottin in Richmond, California, Strutting 
        movements in San Francisco and San Jose, and the Strikin dances of the Oak Park community of Sacramento 
        which were popular through the mid-1960s to the 1970s. Popping would be eventually adapted from earlier 
        Boogaloo (freestyle dance) movements in Fresno, California, in the late 1970s by way of California 
        high-school gatherings of track & meet events - the West Coast Relays. <b></b>
        <br>The dance is rooted through the 
        rhythms of live funk music, and is based on the technique of Boogaloo's posing approach, quickly contracting 
        and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk or can be a sudden stop in the dancer's body, referred to as a pose, 
        pop or a hit. This is done continuously to the rhythm of a song in combination with various movements and poses. 
        It was popularized by a <b>Fresno & Long Beach-based dance group </b>called the Electric Boogaloos that mixed 
        popping techniques to boogaloo. Closely related illusory dance styles and techniques are often integrated 
        into popping to create a more varied performance.<br> These dance styles include the robot, waving and tutting. 
        However, popping is distinct from breaking and locking, with which it is often confused. A popping dancer is 
        commonly referred to as a popper.</p>
