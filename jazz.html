    <h2>Jazz</h2>
    <p>Jazz dance is a performance dance and style that arose in the United States in the mid 20th century. 
        Jazz dance may allude to vernacular jazz about to Broadway or dramatic jazz. The two types expand on 
        African American vernacular styles of dance that arose with jazz music. Vernacular jazz dance 
        incorporates ragtime moves, Charleston, Lindy hop and mambo. Popular vernacular jazz dance performers 
        include The Whitman Sisters, Florence Mills, Ethel Waters, Al Minns and Leon James, Frankie Manning, 
        Norma Miller, Dawn Hampton, and Katherine Dunham. Dramatic jazz dance performed on the show stage was 
        promoted by Jack Cole, Bob Fosse, Eugene Louis Faccuito, and Gus Giordano.</p>
